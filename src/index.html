                        I was selected to take on an Internship position at Orion Health the summer before I started at University. I was placed on a team who were responsible for the creation and deployment of a project called xBDD. xBDD is a system that handles automated and manual testing of many of Orion's products.  The project is now open source and can be viewed on <a href="https://github.com/orionhealth/XBDD">GitHub</a><br />

                        This was a pet project that ended up being commissioned into something more serious. The basic idea was random maths questions that tested a child's basic mathematical abilities. This grew into a live multiplayer "Flash Maths" game and has now grown to a much larger codebase, with a variety of games including a live Mathex timer.  It is currently being used in multiple schools.<br />

                        Here I designed and implemented a "Daily Notices" system that integrated perfectly into their existing SSO set up. It allows teachers to add, edit and delete notices and allows students to view them. Also in early 2015 I was contracted to make a system so that teachers could obtain feedback from students via an online form.  For this I made a system that integrated deeply for the Google Drive APIs and so far it has been a massive success.<br />

                        I was invited back to Orion Health for a second internship at the end of my first year at University.  This time around I was put with a team working on React base web components.  It was my first time using React but now I can't imagine a world without it.  Nearer the end of my time there I was placed on a team working on an Electron based desktop application.  I already had some experience with Electron so my experience with that team was great.<br />

                        After waiting patiently for Google to release their own desktop player for Play Music I couldn't wait any more so I designed the simplest one I could.

                         Mostly thanks to the success of GPMDP I started contributing to the Electron project in early 2015, in July 2015 I was invited into the Electron Org on GitHub and continued supporting, improving and fixing Electron. Since then I have <a href="https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/8095">implemented a touch bar API</a>, <a href="https://beta.electronforge.io">created a brand new build tool</a> and helped out as many people as I can in the Electron Community. Electron is a new-found passion of mine and I hope to keep developing awesome things with it for a long time.<br />

                            <p>OpenLog helps you track down client side javascript errors that you can never seem to replicate on your machine. Now errors and stack traces that happen on any machine will be readily available to you.  Using one JS file on your website and a simple node app on your server you can collect client side logs for anyone accessing your site.</p>
